# Writing Principles

Guidelines for drafting opinion articles. Based on Scott Adams' "The Day You Became a Better Writer" and general best practices.

## Core Rules

### 1. Short sentences
Break long sentences into shorter ones. Readers process information more easily in smaller chunks.

**Instead of:** "The problem with this approach is that it requires users to understand complex technical concepts while also managing their day-to-day responsibilities, which most people simply don't have time for."

**Write:** "This approach requires users to understand complex technical concepts. Most people don't have time for that."

### 2. Simple words
Choose simple words over complex ones. "Use" not "utilize." "Help" not "facilitate." "Show" not "demonstrate."

### 3. Remove unnecessary words
Cut anything that doesn't add value. "Very important" → "important." "In order to" → "to."

### 4. Natural word order
Subject before action. "The company adopted the policy" not "The policy was adopted by the company."

### 5. No throat-clearing
Don't start with "I think," "I believe," "In my opinion." State claims directly. The reader knows it's your opinion.

**Instead of:** "I believe that companies need to change their approach."

**Write:** "Companies need to change their approach."

## Structure Rules

### 6. First sentence creates curiosity
The opening line should make the reader want the second line. Don't start with background or definitions.

### 7. One idea per paragraph
Each paragraph should make one point. If you're making two points, split into two paragraphs.

### 8. Transitions matter
Each section should flow into the next. Use explicit transitions when the connection isn't obvious.

### 9. Concrete beats abstract
Specific examples are more memorable than general principles. Lead with the example, then extract the principle.

### 10. End strong
The last line should land. Don't trail off. Callback to the opening or title if possible.

## Opinion Piece Specifics

### 11. Name the enemy
Opinion pieces need something to push against. Be clear about what you're arguing against (without strawmanning).

### 12. Acknowledge objections
Strong arguments address counterpoints directly. Don't pretend objections don't exist.

### 13. Provide actionable takeaways
Readers should know what to do differently after reading. "What do I do Monday morning?"

### 14. Distinguish claims by confidence
Be clear about what you know vs. what you're predicting. Don't oversell speculation.

## Language

Use **UK/Australian English** spelling and conventions:
- "realise" not "realize"
- "colour" not "color"
- "behaviour" not "behavior"
- "organised" not "organized"
- "centre" not "center"
- "travelled" not "traveled"

## Things to Avoid

- **Jargon without explanation** - If you must use technical terms, define them briefly
- **Passive voice** - Use active voice unless passive is clearly better
- **Hedging** - "Perhaps," "maybe," "it could be argued" weaken your voice
- **Repetition** - Make the point once, well
- **Emojis** - Unless specifically requested
- **Clichés** - "At the end of the day," "paradigm shift," "move the needle"
- **Long quotes** - Paraphrase and cite, or use short punchy quotes only
- **US English spelling** - Use UK/Australian spelling throughout
