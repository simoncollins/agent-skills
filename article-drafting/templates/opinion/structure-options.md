# Narrative Structure Options

Common structures for opinion pieces. Propose 2-3 options with trade-offs. Recommend one or suggest a hybrid.

---

## Option A: The Wake-Up Call

Lead with the disruption thesis. Grab attention with stakes.

**Structure:**
1. Opening hook (stakes, prediction)
2. The old world (how things are now)
3. What changed (why this moment matters)
4. Concrete example
5. The solution/architecture
6. Objections addressed
7. Principles/takeaways
8. Call to action

**Pros:** Urgent, clear stakes, logical flow
**Cons:** Can feel preachy or alarmist

**Best for:** Topics where urgency is genuine and the reader needs to be convinced something is changing

---

## Option B: Concrete-First

Lead with a relatable example. Ground the reader before theorizing.

**Structure:**
1. Opening scene (specific frustration/observation)
2. What you actually wanted
3. Generalization (this isn't just X, it's everything)
4. The shift (what changed)
5. The solution/architecture
6. Why this time is different
7. Principles/takeaways
8. Getting started

**Pros:** Accessible, relatable, shows before tells
**Cons:** Slower to get to the big claim, may lose impatient readers

**Best for:** Topics where you have a strong concrete example that encapsulates the larger argument

---

## Option C: The Contrarian

Start by stating conventional wisdom, then dismantle it.

**Structure:**
1. The conventional wisdom (what everyone believes)
2. "This is wrong."
3. Why it's wrong
4. What's actually true
5. Concrete example
6. The right approach
7. Objections addressed
8. Call to action

**Pros:** Provocative, differentiating, clear enemy
**Cons:** Can feel combative, risks alienating readers who hold the conventional view

**Best for:** Topics where there's a clear mainstream position you're arguing against

---

## Option D: The Journey

Take the reader through your discovery process.

**Structure:**
1. Where you started (your old belief)
2. What made you question it
3. What you discovered
4. The new understanding
5. What it means
6. What to do about it

**Pros:** Personal, humble, reader travels with you
**Cons:** Can feel slow, self-indulgent if overdone

**Best for:** Topics where your personal evolution is interesting and mirrors what the reader might experience

---

## Hybrid Approaches

Often the best structure combines elements:

**B + A Hybrid:** Open with concrete example (B), then escalate to wake-up call stakes (A). Gets the accessibility of B with the urgency of A.

**C + B Hybrid:** State conventional wisdom (C), then use concrete example to show why it's wrong (B). Provocative opening, grounded proof.

## Other Decisions to Present

When proposing structure, also ask the author to decide:

1. **References:** Which external sources to include vs. cut?
2. **Examples:** Which concrete examples to feature prominently?
3. **Length:** Any sections to expand or compress?
4. **Tone:** Any specific phrases or framings to avoid?
