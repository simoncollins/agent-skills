# Critique Template

Use this structure to stress-test the argument in Phase 2. The goal is to strengthen the article by identifying weaknesses early.

---

## Purpose

State: "This document stress-tests the core arguments. The goal is not to defeat the thesis but to identify weak points that need strengthening, claims that need evidence, and objections the article should pre-empt."

---

## Standard Critiques to Consider

### 1. Is this actually new?
- Has this been said before?
- What's the "why now" that makes this moment different?
- How is this distinct from previous similar arguments?

### 2. Absolute claims
- Are any claims too absolute?
- Are there legitimate exceptions?
- Should the thesis be more nuanced?

### 3. Strawmen
- Is the "enemy" position fairly represented?
- Could someone agree with the critique but disagree with the solution?
- Are there steelman versions of opposing views to address?

### 4. Feasibility
- Is this realistic for the target audience?
- What skills/resources does it require?
- Who can actually do this vs. who aspires to?

### 5. Evidence
- What claims need supporting evidence?
- Are examples concrete enough?
- Could a skeptic dismiss this as speculation?

### 6. Missing pieces
- Transition path (how do we get from here to there?)
- Governance/accountability questions
- Edge cases and failure modes
- Who loses in this scenario?

### 7. Strongest counterargument
- What would a smart skeptic say?
- Address this directly in the article
