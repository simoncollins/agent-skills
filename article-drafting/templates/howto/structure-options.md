# Narrative Structure Options: How-To Articles

Common structures for how-to articles. Propose 2-3 options with trade-offs. Recommend one or suggest a hybrid.

---

## Option A: Chronological Journey

Lead with your experience. Walk through the process as you discovered/used it.

**Structure:**
1. Opening hook (the problem you faced)
2. What you tried / what didn't work
3. The approach that worked
4. Process overview
5. Deep dive into key steps (with examples)
6. Results/outcomes
7. Getting started for the reader

**Pros:** Personal, relatable, reader travels with you
**Cons:** May feel slow to readers who want the "how" immediately

**Best for:** Topics where your personal journey is interesting and mirrors what the reader might experience

---

## Option B: Problem-Solution-Proof

Start with the problem, explain the solution, prove it works.

**Structure:**
1. The problem (pain point, why current approaches fail)
2. The solution (overview of your approach)
3. The process in detail (step by step)
4. Proof (case study, examples, results)
5. Getting started

**Pros:** Clear, efficient, readers get actionable steps quickly
**Cons:** Less personal, more instructional, may feel generic

**Best for:** Topics where readers want to get to the "how" quickly without narrative

---

## Option C: Insight-Led

Lead with a surprising insight or counterintuitive discovery.

**Structure:**
1. The unexpected insight (hook)
2. Why this matters / why it's surprising
3. The process that emerged from this insight
4. Deep dive into key steps
5. Results/evidence
6. Getting started

**Pros:** Provocative opening, creates curiosity, differentiates from generic how-to
**Cons:** The "how" comes later, may lose readers who want steps immediately

**Best for:** Topics where you have a genuinely novel insight that challenges conventional wisdom

---

## Option D: The Recipe

Minimal narrative, maximum actionability. Just the steps.

**Structure:**
1. Brief context (what this achieves, who it's for)
2. Prerequisites/setup
3. Step-by-step instructions
4. Troubleshooting common issues
5. Next steps/variations

**Pros:** Scannable, reference-friendly, no fluff
**Cons:** No narrative warmth, may not explain the "why"

**Best for:** Procedural topics where readers just want to execute

---

## Hybrid Approaches

**C + A Hybrid:** Lead with insight (C), then transition into chronological journey (A) showing how it played out. Gets curiosity-hook of C with narrative warmth of A.

**B + D Hybrid:** Problem-solution framing (B) with recipe-style step sections (D). Contextual but highly actionable.

## Other Decisions to Present

When proposing structure, also ask the author to decide:

1. **Examples:** Which concrete examples to feature?
2. **Depth vs. Breadth:** Cover all steps equally, or go deep on the important ones?
3. **Length:** Any sections to expand or compress?
4. **Tone:** Any specific framings or approaches to avoid?
